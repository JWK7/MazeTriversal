# Maze Traversal via Sample Based Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learning)

This project for my CMPE 252 AI class where I led a group of 3 grad students to build a Q-Learning Maze Traversal Python Prototype application. There is an agent that starts in an unknown environment and gradually learns to traverse effectively through the maze from it's start state to the goal state and generates a policy that converges to the optimum. After we wrapped up the project for Spring 2022 semester, I took the challenge of converting my Python code to C++ to account for the possibility that this program could be leveraged for real-time robotics software use case. To see a demo of the Maze Triversal in action and learn more about my process converting the Python to C++ code, check out my demo video.
